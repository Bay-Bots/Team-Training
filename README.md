# Team Training

The purpose of this repository is to help out team's new(er) members to learn more about FTC robotics. We have divided this across multiple weeks to focus on one topic at a time. Each week is divided into its own folder. 

# Focuses
Week 1: Hardware (Motors) 

Week 2: Programming (Motors and Servos)

Week 3: Programming (Sensors) and using Git (if there's time)

Possible future ideas: 
- [ ] How to use Git
- [ ] Working within Android Studio
- [ ] Debugging practice
