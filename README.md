# Team Training

The purpose of this repository is to help new(er) members to learn more about FTC robotics. We have divided this across multiple weeks to focus on one topic at a time. Each week is divided into its own folder. 

Week 1: Hardware (Motors)
Week 2: Programming (Motors and Servos)
Week 3: Working with Android Studio (if we get this far)
Week 4: Using Git for version control (if we get this far)
