The purpose of this week is to build on what we've already learned. Now that we understand how to work with multiple motors in an autonomous program, we will observe similarities and differences in driver control. We will also introduce servos; although, this will be fairly similar to motors with small variations. Next week, we will briefly go over sensors and discuss how Git can be used for version control. 


Example code mentioned is also included below.

Conditions:
```java
     if (gamepad1.a) {
        // do something...
        exampleMotor.setPower(1.0);
     }
     else if (...) {
        ...
     }
     else {
        ...
     }
     ```
